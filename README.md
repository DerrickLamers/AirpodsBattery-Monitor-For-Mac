## Why this App can be useful to you ?

On Mac OS, in order to get the battery information from your AirPods you need to Select your bluetooth device and then navigate to the Battery Mode. Now this time is over ! Just an Eye look to the Top and done !

This is why I build this tiny mac status bar app.

### Why it is not on the App Store ?

This is a MacOSX App build with xCode using Swift 5.0 and Sandbox Not activated in order to beneficiate from the bash permission.

This App cannot be allowed right now on the Mac App Store due to the necessary temporary exceptions required. (Except if you manage to bribe some Apple Reviewers which I did not succeeded yet :))
